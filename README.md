# dw-roguelike
A roguelike based on the original Dragon Warrior.

Sorry, no make file yet, compile with:
$ g++ main.cpp -lcurses -Iinclude

If you do compile the code, the controls are:
Arrow keys
	up is up, down is down, left is left, right is right
x - select
z - cancel
q - brings up the quit dialog, I may get rid of this at some point, or at the very least intend to change the way it works
